							<h1>About OYS</h1>
						<!-- 	<p>
								Since the incorporation of  Order Your Steps (OYS) Sports  Management  in 2010,  we have gone from strength to strength. OYS Sports Management was founded by Liam Bowes &amp; Nathaniel Brown. Our personal relationship with many Premier League &amp; Championship players, inspired us to set up an agency uniquely designed to provide a service for our clients where many other agencies have failed. We found that many top players felt let down and under valued by their agents at crucial times.  When times were good and they were &lsquo;flavor of the month&rsquo; these players were well indulged by their agents, but when times were hard and a good support network was required, that&rsquo;s when many of these agents should have been around but were not. We witnessed first hand the adverse effect this has had on players who were close friends. There was a need for OYS Sports Management and we are proud of the difference we have made to so many of our clients. Many of our clients recommend us to their fellow professionals, and on a few occasions some coaches have recommended our reliable and trustworthy services. For us this speaks volumes for the work we do. We want to continue to work with aspiring players who want to become the best they can be. We want our progressive story to continue with those who want progression.
							</p> -->
							<p>
								We are a football management team with our emphasis firmly being on the word <u><strong>team</strong></u>. We work together, pull together, and reap rewards TOGETHER as a unit. Every team has a star player and that is very much how we view our clients. We are a young, but collectively experienced management team. Our methods are very modern, fresh and vibrant. We have traditional values with regard to business and our approach is our key to success. OYS encourage a very open and friendly relationship with all our clients with as much laid back social interaction as possible. It is vital that everything operates smoothly and seamlessly. We naturally build a good rapport with our clients. We value our clients commitment to us and our clients appreciate how hard we work for them. The OYS objective is to be professional yet relaxed, comfortable but not complacent. We simply want our clients to know that all their career ambitions can be realised with us and in the process we will give them the best  service available without limitations.
